# Pixel War

This project was started by me to replace reddit place. But with a big twist.

## Tech

The website is built with React and javascript.
The server uses NODEJS and mongoDB.
The connection between is through Socket.IO to live update the canvas.

## Main Idea

The main idea is a open canvas where anyone can paint. It should be a place where you log in and concure land on the canvas and at the same time paint with the different colors.

## Twist

To reward those who have played for a longer time they can spend their pixels instead of painting them on building factories. This will give those players more pixels in the long run and with that concure more land. They can also spend pixels on unlocking more colors to express themself in a better way.
